"""
get-user-profile KYB payload-contract audit.

The deployed get-user-profile returned bridge_kyc_status but OMITTED
bridge_account_status (on user_profiles) and bridge_kyb_status (on
business_profiles), so the frontend deriveKycStatus() never received KYB status —
business KYB display/gating fell through to legacy kyc_status. This audit locks the
corrected payload contract: the function must return all three Bridge status fields,
with bridge_kyb_status sourced from business_profiles for business accounts.

Invariants (fail closed):

  (P1) get-user-profile is under repo source control.
  (P2) the returned payload includes bridge_account_status from user_profiles.
  (P3) the returned payload includes bridge_kyb_status, fetched from
       business_profiles, gated on a business account_type.
  (P4) (regression) the payload still includes bridge_kyc_status.

Non-runtime: parses source as text. No deploy, no DB, no network.

Run: python3 tests/audit/get_user_profile_kyb_payload_audit.py   (exit 0 = pass)
