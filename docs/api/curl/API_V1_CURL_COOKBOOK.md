## 0) Environment
```bash
export GATEWAY_URL="https://sandbox.api.borderpayafrica.com"
export API_KEY="<issued_plain_api_key>"
export MODE="sandbox"
export CUSTOMER_ACCESS_TOKEN="<business_customer_session>"
```

## 1) Gateway health
```bash
curl -s "$GATEWAY_URL" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "X-BorderPay-Customer-Authorization: Bearer $CUSTOMER_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-borderpay-route: /v1/health" \
  -H "x-borderpay-mode: $MODE" \
  -d '{"method":"GET"}'
```

## Business signup authorization
Before customer operations, POST `/v1/onboarding-authorizations` using the partner key, a unique Idempotency-Key and:
```json
{"external_user_id":"synthetic-business-001","onboarding_channel":"api","requested_account_types":["business"]}
```
Complete hosted business signup and KYB. Obtain that business customer's session token. Personal-account onboarding is not supported. Owners/directors verify within the business application.

# Second with different body should fail 409 idempotency_replay_mismatch

## Sandbox availability
The sandbox domain and a successful health response do not imply that customer operations are enabled. Ask BorderPay to confirm your tenant's test environment before onboarding or payment tests. Use synthetic data only. Production keys must never be used as a sandbox fallback.
