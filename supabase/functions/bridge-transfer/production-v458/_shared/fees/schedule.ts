/**
 * BorderPay Africa — canonical fee schedule (SERVER / edge authority).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for money math that is ENFORCED
 * server-side. The frontend mirror lives in `utils/fees/schedule.ts` and
 * `tests/audit/borderpay_fee_schedule_audit.py` asserts the two carry the
 * exact same numbers, so what we display can never drift from what the
 * server actually charges.
 *
 * Fee layers — do not conflate them:
 *
 *  1. BRIDGE DEVELOPER FEE — Bridge takes it OUT OF the transfer (its
 *     native `developer_fee_percent`; deducted from the sent amount, never
 *     trusted from the client:
 *       • Virtual-account on-ramp developer fee:
 *         - Individual: 2.5%
 *         - Business:   2.0%
 *       • External-account fiat off-ramp developer fee: 1.0%
 *       • Crypto-to-crypto saved route developer fee: 1.0%
 *       • Same-token crypto external-wallet payout: 0.0%
 *         Bridge rejects developer_fee on USDC->USDC / USDT->USDT wallet payouts.
 *
 *     Bridge fixed trade rates, e.g. USDT 0.999, are NOT developer fees.
 *
 *  2. AFRICAN PAYOUT MARKUP — BorderPay's fixed markup added on top of
 *     whatever African payout partner we route the local-currency leg
 *     through, tiered by subscription plan. Separate from the Bridge
 *     developer fee above.
 *
 *     NOTE: African-currency payout EXECUTION is still gated behind a partner
 *     integration — `bridge-transfer` returns `no_partner` (503) today — so
 *     this table is the canonical definition the payout path will consume
 *     once a partner lands. It does not move money on its own.
